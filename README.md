## 🧭 Business Context

Customer churn directly impacts **revenue, growth, and customer lifetime value (CLV)**.

Organizations must:

- Detect churn risk early
- Understand why customers leave
- Protect high-value segments
- Optimize retention strategies

This project demonstrates how data can be leveraged to **move from reactive to proactive decision-making**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

To build a **scalable analytics system** that:

- Predicts churn probability
- Identifies key churn drivers
- Quantifies **Revenue at Risk**
- Segments customers for targeted retention
- Provides a **Power BI dashboard for executives**

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

- Predictive churn model (Machine Learning)
- Business-ready KPIs and metrics
- Insight-driven dashboard
- Data pipeline (clean → transform → model)
- Portfolio-ready project demonstrating real-world skills

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how raw customer data can be transformed into:

- Predictive intelligence
- Business insights
- Executive dashboards

The focus is on **business impact, not just model accuracy**.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

- Customer demographics
- Account details
- Service usage
- Financial data
- Churn status

---

## 📄 Data Sources

### 🔹 Raw Data
👉 [messy_churn.csv](data/raw/messy_churn.csv)

### 🔹 Processed Data
- 👉 [cleaned_churn.csv](data/processed/cleaned_churn.csv)  
- 👉 [featured_churn.csv](data/processed/featured_churn.csv)  
- 👉 [feature_importance.csv](data/processed/feature_importance.csv)

---

## ⚙️ Data Pipeline

### 🔹 Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates
- Handled missing values
- Fixed inconsistent categories
- Created:
  - `has_internet`
  - `has_phone`

---

### 🔹 Feature Engineering
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Average Revenue
- High Value Customers
- Loyal Customers

---

### 🔹 Model Training
- Random Forest Classifier
- Feature importance extraction
- Model saved for reuse (`model.pkl`)

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

The model predicts churn and identifies key drivers such as:

- Contract type
- Tenure
- Monthly charges
- Customer segmentation

---
